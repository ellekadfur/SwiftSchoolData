        struct Constants { //ljc - because this app isn't using any of the data point in the model, I didn't use Codable, CodingKeys, KeyedDecodingContainer. For the Unit Testing, simply testing that the view model returned the data is sufficient, in a professional app, we want to test each use case. Unfortuntately, I do not have time for this here, so I have just created KEY below to crap value from DATA MODEL

        //MARK: Properties -
        private let service: ServiceProtocol!
        var items: [Item] = []//ljc - would make this private and add accessing method if given more time and was professional app
        
        //MARK: LifeCycle -

            service = apiService

        func fetch(completion: @escaping (()-> Void)) {
            service.fetchSchools { [unowned self] (value, isSuccessful) in//ljc - i would create ResultStatus Type in professional app, instead of isSuccessful Boolean

                    } else {
                        //ljc - in professional app, we would want to pass success/fail to VC in completion, to update UI this app is demonstration of use of data mostly so not needed.
